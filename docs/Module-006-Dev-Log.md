#### Goals for this Module
- Complete the "Dev. Log" assignment.
- Complete the "Design Treatment" assignment.

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Completed the "Dev. Log" assignment.
  - Completed the "Design Treatment" assignment.
- **Challenges faced**:
  - It was a bit difficult to come up with ideas to flesh out section(s) for the "Design Treatment" assignment.
- **Solutions**:
  - I am using various Internet resources in addition to course materials to get inspirations to flesh out the section(s) for the "Design Treatment" assignment.
#### Learnings
- I learned that it isn't easy to come up with ideas for a game design treatment document.
- I learned that a game design treatment document is a "living document", meaning that it's constantly updated as time goes on.

#### Free Thinking
- How do I come up with a game idea without it being too similar to one that already exists on the market?
  - I could get inspiration from games that I have played or love in general.

#### Next Steps
- Make sure that the initial version of the design treatment document is completed and that I'm prepared to start creating a physical prototype of the game.
