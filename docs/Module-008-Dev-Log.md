#### Goals for this Module
- Learn about the features of a game engine.
- Learn about concepts and design.
- Continue to listen to the presentations of the physical prototypes that we're making of our games based on the design treatment.
- Complete the "Dev. Log" assignment.

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Learned about the features of a game engine.
  - Learned about concepts and design.
  - Continued to listen to the presentations of the physical prototypes that we're making of our games based on the design treatment. This is ongoing.
  - Completed the "Dev. Log" assignment.
- **Challenges faced**:
  - I continued to have difficulty in understanding some of the presentations.
- **Solutions**:
  - I continued to ask questions to the presenters to help clarify the unclear stuff about the presentations.

#### Learnings
- I learned about the features of a game engine through the class session(s).
- I learned about the notion of concepts and design through the class session(s).
- I reflected on the fact that it isn't easy to make a physical prototype of a game.

#### Free Thinking
- N/A

#### Next Steps
- Continue to listen to the presentations of the physical prototypes.
- Make sure that I understand the new concepts that I learned, which are the features of a game engine and concepts/design.
- Make sure that I'm ready for the concept(s) that will be covered in the next lesson(s).
