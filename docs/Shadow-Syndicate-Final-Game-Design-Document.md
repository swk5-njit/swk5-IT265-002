## **Change Log**

### **Version 1.0 (Testing & Physical Prototype)**

- **Primary Changes:**
  - Introduced a simplified rule set for the initial testing/physical prototyping phase to streamline gameplay.
  - Limited character abilities and resources to ensure balance between players.
  - Introduced modular role cards to enhance replayability.

#### **Analysis of Changes:**
- **Simplified Rule Set**: As the game is in the testing/physical prototype phase, the rule set is simplified so that gameplay is streamlined for testing.
- **Limited Character Abilities**: As the game is in the testing/physical prototype phase, the character abilities are limited in order to ensure that the game isn't too complex.
- **Modular Role Cards**: The addition of modular role cards allowed for greater variability in gameplay, ensuring no two sessions played out the same. This change was driven by the feedback on the lack of replayability.

### **Version 1.1 (Digital Prototype)**

- **Primary Changes:**
  - Expanded character abilities to allow more interaction and strategic depth.
  - Adjusted resource management mechanics for more challenging decisions.
  - Improved iconography for clarity and accessibility.
  - Enhanced AI for solo playtesting, providing more challenging non-player competitors.
  - Added new role variations, including a wildcard character that can adopt any role during the game.
  - Refined the cyber-noir aesthetic with more dynamic glitch effects and neon highlights.

#### **Analysis of Changes:**
- **Expanded Character Abilities**: Initial testing revealed that players lacked enough strategic variety, making gameplay feel flat. Expanding character abilities allowed for more meaningful decision-making and interaction.
- **Resource Management Adjustments**: Playtesters felt that resource management was too simple and lacked depth. Introducing more complex decisions regarding resource usage increased the challenge and excitement of the game.
- **Improved Iconography**: Initial iconography was too complex, leading to confusion. Simplifying and clarifying the icons improved accessibility for players with different literacy levels and those with colorblindness.
- **Enhanced AI**: Solo playtesting feedback showed that the game lacked challenge when played against AI. Improving the AI allowed players to enjoy the game even without a full group of people.
- **New Role Variations**: Introducing a wildcard character added an element of unpredictability, which was a response to feedback about the game’s occasional predictability. It enhanced the strategic depth and excitement.
- **Refined Aesthetic**: Feedback from digital playtests suggested that the glitch effects were initially too subtle. Amplifying the glitch effects and using neon highlights helped reinforce the cyberpunk aesthetic and improved the overall visual experience.
