#### Goals for this Module
- Learn about game mechanics.
- Complete the "Dev. Log" assignment.
- Complete the "Color Theory" Case Study assignment.

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Learned about game mechanics.
  - Completed the "Dev. Log" assignment.
  - Completed the "Color Theory" Case Study assignment.
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Some of the questions on the "Color Theory" Case Study assignment were difficult, especially the sections about narrative enhancement through color and complementary sound design as the Atari game that I had researched for the earlier case study didn't have much of a story nor what people would consider to be music.
- **Solutions**:
  - I have responded to the difficult questions on the "Color Theory" Case Study assignment to the best of my ability.

#### Learnings
- I leaarned about the concept of game mechanics through the class session(s).
- I learned about the significance of color theory through the case study.
- I learned that it is difficult to redesign a classic game, as certain aspects such as narrative enhancement are hard to come up with ideas for when the initial game lacked such information to begin with.

#### Free Thinking
- N/A

#### Next Steps
- Make sure that I understand the new concept that I learned, which is the concept of game mechanics.
