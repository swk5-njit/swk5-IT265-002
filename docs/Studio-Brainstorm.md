## Studio Name Ideas

  - Brinley Entertainment

- **Chosen Name**: Brinley Productions
- **About the name**: Brinley is a gender-neutral name that I love to use, which means "burnt meadow". Even though Brinley might sound negative from its meaning, I found out that fire is often used in agriculture to promote new growth and that resonated with me. I decided to go with "Productions" as part of the name since I feel like making video games means that you're producing something for people to ultimately enjoy.
